Over time, [tada](https://tada.tada.science) will get more tools and will serve as a host for all things tada[⬢]{style=\"color:pink; font-size: 120%\"}science.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tada)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\n  🎉🎉                               🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                               🎉🎉\n🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉       🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉            🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉          🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉   🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉  🎉      🎉🎉     🎉🎉  🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉      🎉🎉\n   🎉🎉🎉🎉      🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe [pkg_roulette()](http://tada.tada.science/reference/pkg_roulette.html) gives you the `time=` and `n=` arguments to control how long the roulette runs and how many packages it shows. It goes increasingly slowly during that time. You can also control the colors it uses with the `cols=` argument. But you don't need to, the defaults are fine.\n\n![](roulette.gif)\n\n[tada](https://tada.tada.science) is on its way to CRAN, but you don't need to wait, and you can start using it right now with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npak::pak(\"tadascience/tada\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n💡 You have ideas to improve it, awesome 👍 let's chat about it on [github](https://github.com/tadascience/tada), on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/romain-francois_welcome-to-the-tadaverse-i-played-activity-7157690935936499713-gxoA), on [X](https://x.com/romain_francois/status/1751951394439913520?s=20), on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/romainfrancois.bsky.social/post/3kk4ov2vgs52v), on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@romainfrancois/111839335940660715), on [threads](https://www.threads.net/@romain_francois) or however you usually get in touch.\n\n🦘 don't go too far, I'll be back in this blog.\n",
