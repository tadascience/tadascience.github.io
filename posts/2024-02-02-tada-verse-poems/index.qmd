I just received the *Thanks, on its way to CRAN* email 📧 about the [tada](tada.tada.science) package 🎉, so it's a good time for a celebration, and what better way to celebrate than with a dash of poetry.

The `@dev` version gains a `verse()` function to write poetry about R packages, thanks for the heavy lifting of the [mlverse/chattr](https://mlverse.github.io/chattr/) 📦. We try to maintain a `@main` branch that could be released at any time, and `chattr` is not yet released. We hope it will be for the spring 🌤️ release of [tada](tada.tada.science), but it will be for the meantime available in the `@dev` branch.

```{r echo=FALSE}
chattr::chattr_use("gpt35")
```

So let's dive right in and do some [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) poetry 🪶

For additional fun, we can write some poetry about a random package we discover with [tada::pkg_roulette()](https://tada.tada.science/reference/pkg_roulette.html)

```{r eval=FALSE}
tada::pkg_roulette() |> tada::verse()
```
