We'll get to *what* it is and what it does soon enough, but *it is*, it exists as a company, where as before it was just a name I used. We might start to *we* more than we I as a consequence, but for now let me wrap what happened in february.

## AI poetry

We started off by adding the tada::verse() function to generate [praise poetry](../2024-02-02-tada-verse-poems/) using ChatGPT through the {chattr} ðŸ“¦.

This was fun, but quickly opened a can of worms, because tada::verse() would not work for some packages, because of a bug in {chattr}. At least that's what I initially assumed, and logged [an issue](https://github.com/mlverse/chattr/issues/63) for it.

<img src="https://snitch.tada.science/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> {chattr} is not a trivial package, and so I went on a little debugging quest to find out what the problem was, and developed {snitch} along the way to help with tracing. {snitch} has helped, but it is still a little clunky, so it will stay unreleased until it is somewhat better, or just sit in the unreleased ðŸ“¦ graveyard.

<img src="https://httr2.r-lib.org/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> turned out the underlying problem was a missed opportunity in {httr2}, which was the perfect excuse to dive in, learn about {httr2} and eventually settle with a proposal to add a `round=` argument to httr2::req_perform_stream(). It has been great working on this with Hadley on the [pull request](https://github.com/r-lib/httr2/pull/437). I sure was easier that we have a lot of experience working together, but I believe we both contributed to the vision and ended up with a simple, nice and extensible way to solve the initial problem. Long story short, when you stream text with httr2::req_perform_stream(), you just do `httr2::req_perform_stream(round = "line")`.

<img src="https://valentine.tada.science/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> For {valentine} we went a different way to engage with ChatGPT and simply use the 
{openai} package instead of {chattr}. That loses sreaming along the way, but that's fine. Now that httr2::req_perform_stream() is more resilient, we can imagine to contribute a streaming 
feature to {openai}. Similarly, we might switch to using Gemini and contribute to 
{gemini.R} or develop a `mistral.ai` package to use [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) instead. {valentine} was fun to play with. 

## react

<img src="https://react.tada.science/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> {react} is a different beast, it was initially meant as a goofy ðŸ“¦ but it git some 
engagement on various socials, so it might have more potential than initially envisionned, or maybe this is just because it's a {shiny} âœ¨ thing . 

## link

Because February was a slow month, I ended up with some available bandwidth, and
decided to time block feb 23 to learn about and initiate contributions to the 
[pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/). I'm coming to this with extensive 
experience in a [different verse](https://tidyverse.org), but because the 
pharmaâ¬¡verse is not a trivial collection of packages, I approached the day by 
initiating a conversation on the slack to collect ideas on how to best allocate my time. I was lucky enough to get ideas from the community, and I look forward to 
do more in depth pharmaâ¬¡verse work in the future. 

<img src="https://link.tada.science/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> However, the day quickly evolved to crafting the {link} package
that is designed to help with automatically generate links to packages and functions in your quarto/Rmarkdown posts, i.e. these links are generated automatically: {link} and dplyr::across(). Kudos to the {downlit} package that does most of the heavy lifting. 

I like that throughout the day, the solution got more and more generic, to the point that {link} eventually is not pharmaâ¬¡verse specific, but rather a general tool to help with blogging ... It might be interesting to go further in generality and include the 
feature automatically in [quarto](https://quarto.org/). To be continued. 

## duckdb

<img src="https://r.duckdb.org/logo.png" style="margin:5px; float:left" width="80/"/> Last month, I started working with [cynkra](https://www.cynkra.com/) on a [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) extension ðŸ¦† that will eventually contribute to 
{duckplyr}. {duckplyr} is a {dplyr} replacement built natively on top of {duckdb}, 
that's ðŸ˜Ž. I look forward to contribute more to this. If you're curious about it, the best place is this posit::conf talk from Kirill.

## To be continued

That's a wrap for this wrapup, March will look different for tada [â¬¢]{style="color: pink"} science, but the dedication to R is intact.
