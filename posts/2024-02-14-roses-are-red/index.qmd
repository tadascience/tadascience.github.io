<a href="https://valentine.tada.science"><img src="logo.png" align="left" height="138"/></a> To get ready, *at least in the R world* 😝, for Valentine's day, I've cooked a little R 📦 to spread the love by generating *Roses are Red, ...* poems about packages using ChatGPT though the [openai](https://irudnyts.github.io/openai/) package.

You can install it with `pak::pak("tadascience/valentine")` and perhaps it will be released in time for Valentine's day.

```{r}
valentine::roses("tidyverse")
```

You can tweak the prompt that is sent with the `hint=` argument.

```{r}
valentine::roses("lubridate", hint = "make it kinky")
```
