```{r}
#| echo: false
link::auto(keep_braces = FALSE, keep_pkg_prefix = FALSE)
```

{link} is a simple goofy R ðŸ“¦ that makes it simple to include links to packages, e.g. {tidyverse}, {dplyr} and function calls dplyr::summarise() ggplot2::ggplot() in your `.Rmd` or `.qmd` files.

This works by setting the {knitr} `text` hook with link::auto() somewhere in your document. You can learn more about {knitr} hooks in the [Writing knitr hooks](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-12-30_knitr-hooks/) article from Danielle Navarro's [Notes from a data witch](https://blog.djnavarro.net) blog.

````         
`r ''````{r}
#| echo: false
link::auto(keep_braces = FALSE, keep_pkg_prefix = FALSE)
```
````

The defaults \`keep_braces = TRUE\` and \`keep_pkg_prefix\` keeps the braces around the ðŸ“¦ names and the package prefix in the calls. This is popular style but I don't like it and find it too noisy.

{link} is heavily based on {downlit} and especially downlit::href_package() and downlit::autolink() which do the actual work. We just go the extra mile and make this automatic by means of a {knitr} hook.

This very article uses link::auto(), i.e. here is how it looks in rstudio:
