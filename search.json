    "text": "This is the first article for the tada⬢science blog, so before we deep dive into changing the world, let’s have some fun 🛝.\nWhen I linkedined about the You & R upcoming podcast 🎙️ back in December, I shared some code on the survey with potential guests.\n\n\n\n\n\n… but as I’m getting ready to launch 🚀 soon - more on that shortly 🕥 🕥 🕗 🕔 - I wanted something a bit more fun, so I wrote the pkg_roulette() function this morning and giftwrapped 🎁 it up as the tada package that is on its way to CRAN. Over time, tada will get more tools and will serve as a host for all things tada⬢science.\n\nlibrary(tada)\n\n\n  🎉🎉                                  🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                                  🎉🎉\n🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉       🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                  🎉🎉    🎉🎉   🎉🎉             🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉          🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉   🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉  🎉      🎉🎉     🎉🎉  🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉      🎉🎉\n   🎉🎉🎉🎉      🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉    🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n\n\nThe pkg_roulette() gives you the time= and n= arguments to control how long the roulette runs and how many packages it shows. It goes increasingly slowly during that time. You can also control the colors it uses with the cols= argument. But you don’t need to, the defaults are fine.\n\ntada is on its way to CRAN, but you don’t need to wait, and you can start using it right now with:\n\npak::pak(\"tadascience/tada\")\n\n💡 You have ideas to improve it, awesome 👍 let’s chat about it on github, on linkedin, on X, on bluesky, on mastodon, on threads or however you usually get in touch.\n🦘 don’t go too far, I’ll be back in this blog.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{françois2024,\n  author = {François, Romain},\n  title = {Welcome to the Tada\\textless span\n    Style=“color:pink;”\\textgreater⬢\\textless/Span\\textgreater verse},\n  date = {2024-01-29},\n  url = {https://tada.science/posts/2024-01-29-welcome-to-the-tadaverse},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFrançois, Romain. 2024. “Welcome to the Tada&lt;span\nStyle=‘color:pink;’&gt;⬢&lt;/Span&gt;verse.” January\n29, 2024. https://tada.science/posts/2024-01-29-welcome-to-the-tadaverse."
