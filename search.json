Over time, tada will get more tools and will serve as a host for all things tada⬢science.\n\nlibrary(tada)\n\n\n  🎉🎉                               🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                               🎉🎉\n🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉       🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉                🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉            🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉          🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉   🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n  🎉🎉  🎉      🎉🎉     🎉🎉  🎉🎉     🎉🎉   🎉🎉      🎉🎉\n   🎉🎉🎉🎉      🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉     🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉\n\n\nThe pkg_roulette() gives you the time= and n= arguments to control how long the roulette runs and how many packages it shows. It goes increasingly slowly during that time. You can also control the colors it uses with the cols= argument. But you don’t need to, the defaults are fine.\n\ntada is on its way to CRAN, but you don’t need to wait, and you can start using it right now with:\n\npak::pak(\"tadascience/tada\")\n\n💡 You have ideas to improve it, awesome 👍 let’s chat about it on github, on linkedin, on X, on bluesky, on mastodon, on threads or however you usually get in touch.\n🦘 don’t go too far, I’ll be back in this blog.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{françois2024,\n  author = {François, Romain},\n  title = {Welcome to the Tada\\textless span\n    Style=“color:pink;”\\textgreater⬢\\textless/Span\\textgreater verse},\n  date = {2024-01-29},\n  url = {https://tada.science/posts/2024-01-29-welcome-to-the-tadaverse},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFrançois, Romain. 2024. “Welcome to the Tada&lt;span\nStyle=‘color:pink;’&gt;⬢&lt;/Span&gt;verse.” January\n29, 2024. https://tada.science/posts/2024-01-29-welcome-to-the-tadaverse."

Working on bootstrapping this project with the QuantStack team has been a privilege. Our vision is that it is going to open many doors for the intersection of Jupyter and R users. There is still a lot to do, let’s go 🚀."

It’s early days at the time of writing this wrapup, i.e. the landing page mostly contain a 🎉 emoji, but what else do you need really, that’s the best emoji.\nI’ve asked ChatGPT what a tada scientist is, and this is one of this cases where the 🤖 was a bit unimaginative and gave me the typo treatment:\n\nIt seems like there might be a typo in your question. Did you mean to ask about a “data scientist”? A data scientist is a professional who uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. They often apply their skills in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and generate actionable insights. If this is not what you meant, could you please clarify your question?\n\n… I would have prefered an hallucination 💭 in that instance, so I guess we are going to have to invent what is a tada⬢science, I’ll expand on that over time, but we can start with a new spin on the practice of data science. Let’s go from tidy data to tada duty 🤝."

You can find our more (not really) about it in this blog post but if you’re in a rush, here it is again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was received with a bit of curiosity and enthusiasm and a drop of “is that it?” from the community when I posted about it on linkedin and various other socials. I can relate to both the enthusiasm and the frustration, it’s a 🐣 package at this point. It will serve as a host for various tools to support the practice of tada⬢science."

You & R is meant to be people centered safe place where we exchange stories about how we relate to R. I’ll invite people across() 😉 the spectrum of trajectories. No matter where you ® in your journey with our favorite data science tool, your story matters, and we’re all in this together. I want to hear and amplify stories about new R users who give us the privilege to hop on board this ⛵️ with us, as well as more experience R users.\nI’m currently in the process of gearing up 🎙️🎧 🎥 and learning about things 🛠️ like riverside, so please bear with my while I upskill and stay tuned 🎶 for more You & R news."

Finding about about Never Search Alone has been a pivotal moment in my transition from my previous work life. As much as fast reading the book front to cover in two days was exciting, actually doing the work with a JSC is another level, I would recommend it to anyone going through a work cross roads moment.\nLet’s see how it goes, but I’ll probably write about how I’m adapting the NSA approach to my specifics."

Learning to Lead, Leading to Learn is next on my list on the same theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso finished Unbroken: the Trauma response is never wrong on a totally different topic. The trauma tapes is one of my favourite podcasts and the book goes further.\nWhat Now, with Trevor Noah is an another one of my favourite podcasts, and the episode featuring Kerry Washington is what converted me to sign up to Audible. This is a fascinating story. Next on my Audible queue is Viola Davis’s Finding Me.\nOn the more technical front, I’ll go through C++20: the complete guide because there seems to be a lot of interesting new things happening in C++ 🤓🚀."
